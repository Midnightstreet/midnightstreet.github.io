      <h2 align="center">Welcome to Midnightstreet</h2>
      <p align="center">Midnightstreet is my side project in which I recreate "or at least emulate" the old days when furry flash games were popular by creating my own interactive animated/games using modern and open-source software such as Wick Editor or other than use Flash.</p>
	
      <h2 align="center">&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2 align="center">Why I'm Starting This Project</h2>
      <p align="center">When I revisit old furry flash games, it feels like nostagia for me as an old furry, "yeah, I joined furry a long time ago," so I'd like to make my own interactive animated/games, but since Flash is killed by Adobe, I'd be better off using other software.</p>
	
      <p align="center">So I started to research and learn about some game engines like Unity, Godot, and others. However, all of those are app-based game engines that need to be installed and run, but what I really need is an engine that creates browser-based games that can be accessed using a modern browser. Then I discovered Wick Editor, which is very similar to Flash, but it's still in development and doesn't have many features like Flash for now.</p>
	
      <p align="center">But I'm willing to give a chance to try Wick Editor's. After all, I really like all the features it has, so if you're interested in trying Wick Editor, you guys could check in on the link below.</p>

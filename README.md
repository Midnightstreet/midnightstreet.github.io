# MIdnightstreet

Midnightstreet is my side project in which I recreate "or at least emulate" the old days when furry flash games were popular by creating my own interactive animated/games using modern and open-source software such as Wick Editor or other than use Flash.


## Mostly interactive content is made using Wick Editor.
